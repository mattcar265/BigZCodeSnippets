It ended up being all new written code saved under: [wave-form-previews.liquid](https://admin.shopify.com/store/big-z-sounds/themes/79137013832)

# Adding an audio file
The audio files are all uploaded to the [Content > files](https://admin.shopify.com/store/big-z-sounds/content/files?selectedView=all) tab of the admin menu
To add a new song, you can add it to the Content tab, then get a link from the button to the right, and put the link at the very bottom of the .liquid file, with the rest of the songs.
